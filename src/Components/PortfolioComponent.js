                        My thesis project for the Commonwealth Honors College at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This study aims to understand if ethical user experience design leads to more satisfying user
                        experiences. We are particularly interested in the ethical design of social media applications, as
                        they are primarily used heavily every day by a majority of todayâ€™s population who use the
                        internet daily.</p>

                        Red Panda Town is a small social networking website/demo that I've created from scratch. It is inspired by several social networking websites, notably Facebook. I have coded the entire site from scratch using my knowledge of HTML, 
                        CSS, PHP, and am using mySQL to store database information. This project is deprecated and closed and will no longer be worked on.</p>
